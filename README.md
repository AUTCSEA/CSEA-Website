# !Notice for contributors!

Anyone is more than welcome to help out, but please create a separate branch for the feature you plan to work on and create a pull request (PR) into master when the feature is done. Then let Peter or Ivan know of the PR so that we can review the code and merge into master :)

Also please communicate in the discord server of what you'll be working on so we dont waste time working on the same thing.
